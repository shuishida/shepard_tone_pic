# Shepard Tone Generator for PIC

Playing Shepard Tone on a PIC microcontroller.
There are three assembly code, each to be written into a PIC16F628A microcontroller.

- `tone_generator.asm`: code for the PIC that generates the Shepard Tone
- `tone_display.asm`: code for the PIC that displays the track number
- `track_selector.asm`: code for the PIC that selects the track number

The program expects the following circuit:
